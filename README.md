## Recipe Finder!

This is my final project for our SEI course at GA. Ever since this lockdown started, I often find myself wondering what else I can cook with all the ingredients I have in my fridge. Well, I wondered no more! I have created a recipe finder site, where you just put in the ingredients you have on hand and it will suggest recipes you can cook it with. This is my way of practicing all the front end development tools and have a deeper understanding with React. A live demo link can be seen [here](https://determined-jepsen-a9e0e0.netlify.app/#/).

### Technologies Used

This site was made by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and the [Edamam API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api).

### Features
- Users can search recipes by typing out the ingredients on the search box.
- Users also has the option to filter by diet and health labels.
- Users will be redirected to the site of the recipe for full details.

### Wish List
- Add a loading screen while getting data from the API
- Display missing ingredients on the results page
- "Infinity scroll" to display all recipes instead of just 12
- Create a separate site and API specifically for Filipino recipes

### Acknowledgements
I learned a lot from this 3-month GA course and I would like to extend my gratitude to the following people:
- My GA mentor, Meo So, who was always been there every time I ask for advice on my projects. Thanks again for the API suggestion!
- Joel and Aleks, who are the BEST instructors in my heart for being patient with us and for guiding us into this incredible world of coding. I still wish it wasn't the end, but here we are :(
- My SEI 36 batchmates- WOOOOOO WE MADE IT!!! Thank you for being awesome and I hope to see you all again very soon!
- My husband, Kim, whose unwavering patience and understanding, was there to support me through this rollercoaster journey (sudden mood swings, panic attacks, etc) and has always believed in my skills! WE MADE IT!! WOOOOO! *kaluguran daka!*
- My family, though they may be miles away, has also supported me in this journey, even though I know in my heart, they will always see me as that person who can only fix their internet, their printer, their cellphone and a bunch of technology-related things. *love you!*
